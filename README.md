# meteor-deploy-issue
This repo replicates the deployment issue I get when deploying to AWS using [`mup`](https://github.com/zodern/meteor-up) (v1.3.4 ~ latest)

After a successful `$ mup setup`, I run `$ mup deploy` and get this output:

```

The main line being:

```tar: Malformed extended header: missing newline```

A quick Google finds [this](https://github.com/mafintosh/tar-fs/issues/21) issue with the `tar-fs` package.

This repo has the exact npm dependencies from my production application and apprently somewhere there is a filename
with non-ascii characters. I've tried a few commands to see if I can find filenames with bad chars in. but had no success.

## Replicate issue

```
$ git clone git@github.com:alexpriceonline/meteor-deploy-issue.git
$ cd meteor-deploy-issue
```

Change the `./mup.js`, `server.one`s `host`, `username` and `pem` properties to that of a server you have deploy access too.

Make sure you have [`mup`](https://github.com/zodern/meteor-up) installed (`yarn global add mup`).

```
$ mup setup
$ mup deploy
```
